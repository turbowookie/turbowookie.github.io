    <p>
      Turbo Wookie is a whimsically named product. More importantly, it's a collaborative music jukebox which streams music to multiple clients concurrently.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that doesn't really explain anything, in less technical terms, Turbo Wookie is a collaborative jukebox; a group of people (probably friends?) can start up a Turbo Wookie instance, share the address amongst themselves, and build a playlist that they'll be able to listen to at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it like an internet radio station, but the only music played is yours, and the DJ is everyone you let access your Turbo Wookie instance.
    </p>


    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Turbo Wookie started as a group final project for a Software Design and Development course. We liked it more than the other ideas proposed to the group.
    </p>


    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Turbo Wookie has four main components, in three parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Music Stream. That's manipulable.</li>
      <li>A Music Library.</li>
      <li>A Web Server that serves clients and manipulates the stream.</li>
      <li>A Web-based Frontend. Because who wants to download another application?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The three parts are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.musicpd.org">MPD</a> (Music Player Daemon). It acts as both our stream and library.</li>
      <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/turbowookie/turbo-wookie/tree/master/backend">backend server</a>, written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>.</li>
      <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/turbowookie/turbo-wookie/tree/master/frontend/turbo_wookie">frontend</a>, written in <a href="http://dartlang.org">Dart</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Thus far, running Turbo Wookie been tested on Linux (Ubuntu and Arch) and Windows. Presumably it'll run on OS X, we just don't have any team members running OS X.
